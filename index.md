<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi! </h1>

My name's [Matthew](https://matthewelsom.com), and I built this [Jekyll-based](http://jekyllrb.com/) tool that you can use to generate and document product or system user interface (UI) patterns in a simple [Style Guide](https://jekyllstyleguide.com).


## Why?

There are a lot of really great style guide methods, tools and [examples](http://styleguides.io) out there... but, I struggled to find one that was:

- easy and quick to use,
- simple to maintain,
- a match for my current workflow,
- flexible enough to use on a wide variety of projects.

## Requirements

I decided that the following requirements would meet my needs: 

- Use only [Jekyll](https://jekyll.rb) as a pre-requisit
- Use HMTL/CSS/JS to build a web component, template, etc. (I called these 'patterns')
- Track the 'maturity' of a pattern - i.e. is it ready to use, or not?
- Automatically add all patterns into a 'Roadmap'
- Enable simple documentation for developers, designers and product owners to use
- Provide a style guide container or 'shell' that is unobtrusive and easy to visually customize
